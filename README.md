# shift-calculator

Using Googles OR-Tools we want to create an automatic shift calculator with the following contraints:

- shifts
    - Monday
        - 13:00 to 13:30 (next day)
        - 09:00 to 20:00
    - Thuesday
        - 13:00 to 9:00 (next day)
        - 09:00 to 20:00
    - Wednesday
        - 13:00 to 9:00 (next day)
        - 14:00 to 20:00
    - Thursday
        - 13:00 to 9:00 (next day)
        - 14:00 to 20:00
    - Friday
        - 13:00 to 13:30 (next day)
        - 14:00 to 20:00
    - Saturday
        - 13:00 to 13:30 (next day)
        - 09:00 to 20:00
            - every second week
    - Sunday
        - 13:00 to 13:30 (next day)
        - 09:00 to 20:00
            - every second week
    - holidays like Mo-Fri
        - except Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
            - 09:00 to 20:00

        - day shift
        - night+day shift (36h)

    - some workers should not relief specific workers

    - not two consecutive night shifts
    - every worker should have a free weekend
    - every worker should have count of weekend days + public holidays free days per month

    - Mo-Thur
        - 22-5 counts as quarter of work time
